Swing.js
========

Swing.js is a lightweight collection of javascript components to help reduce the need for bloated 3rd-party libraries. It's primary goals are:

* Keeping filesizes small where possible.
* Allowing components to be loaded independently (only load what you need).
* Allowing components to be loaded in any sequence.
* Supporting all modern browsers.
